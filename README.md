# color-based-apf-algorithm
This is a 2D color-based APF algorithm, which ensures obstacle avoidance in path planning towards a specified target. This APF algorithm enhances adaptability in dynamic environments by allowing an object to navigate without prior knowledge of obstacles. Instead of relying on a predefined map, it operates using a live, color-coded map generated from an overhead perspective. Obstacles are marked in real-time as red dots, but the navigating object (e.g., a drone or robot) only perceives a local section of this map at any given moment. This means the object doesn’t need to process or store the entire environment—just the immediate area around it—making it highly efficient for real-time navigation.

Unlike traditional APF methods that assume static or pre-mapped obstacles, this approach reacts dynamically to new obstacles as they appear. It is well-suited for unpredictable or evolving environments, such as autonomous robotics in crowded spaces, drones navigating unknown terrains, or any scenario where obstacles change over time.
